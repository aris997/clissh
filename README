# CliSSH

A simple `config` reader that stdout the list of Hosts available
and then ask to which of the hosts to run the ssh command. 

## Installation

You may compile it with `gcc` or run the command `make`.
Once the binary is ready you should grant it the executable
permission with the command:

```shell
chmod +x clissh
```

and then move it to a suitable folder where the shell can call it.
I moved the binary to the `~/.local/bin/` folder with

```shell
mv clissh ~/.local/bin
```

### Warning

This is a very early program, I like programming and so you should too.
Take this simple program as an experiment, you can read the source
C code from the file. License should be MIT.
I also use Claude to add arguments to the program, it helped me uravel
the argc argv managing.

> Use it at your risk.

## Usage

### Specify config file

```shell
clissh -f /path/to/config
```

this way you can specify the file to read.

### Edit the config file

Yo may want to edit the config file, to do so you can run the 
following command: 

```shell
clissh --edit
```

and it will open the ~/.ssh/config file with the configured $EDITOR.

#### Combine options

You can specify a config file and edit it just combining the two options.
